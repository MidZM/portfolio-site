                    Symbiotic is a Visual Novel that revolves around a kid named Zaydin and his "friends", of whom he can't stand, being the last thing standing between Earth's survival and total annihilation. With the arrival of the planet eating Symbiote planet Metamor, Earth has been forced to create it's own Symbiote creatures to save the planet from destruction. However, due to complications with these man-made Symbiote creatures, they are unable to bond with adults. When bonded with an adult it will over their mind and cause them to go on a murderous rampage, the only people who can safely bond with the Symbiotes are children under the age of 18.

The project was created to serve two purposes, the first being a question to myself of whether or not I could animate a full length animations.  The second purpose was to try and build up a fan base for the video that would hopefully transfer over to the webcomic "Marked" that it was based on, but sadly the video never picked up traction and the comic eventually went on permanent hiatus due to burn out and a dying medium (Western comics).  The story will be re-told at some point in a different medium in the future, likely as a video game.
                    <br><br>
                    The pixelation/quality on some scenes is a result of the image complier I used to turn it into a video, future animations use a different image complier (Blender) for cleaner lines and quality.
                    <br><br>
                    The song used in this animation is Shelter by Porter Robinson & Madeon, I take no credit for it.
                    <br><br>
                    The characters used in this animation are a part of a Webcomic called "Marked", and were created by me.`

Chapter 9 was meant to be the chapter that changed the entre dynamic of the story by basically wiping the slate clean and restarting back at 0, while giving the main protagonist serious trauma that would follow him the entire series.
                    <br><br>
                    While it did hype up select few individuals who were following the story, it did not have the impact I had hoped for by bringing attention to the webcomic from people who enjoyed the animation and wanted to know what was going on.`

                    <br><br>
                    The animation was made in 2016 and uploaded to DeviantART, a year later it was uploaded to YouTube.  It's a short animation, and since then the character designs, among other things, have changed.  The animation comes from a webcomic that I used to work on called "Marked", development of the webcomic was halted due to burn out and a dying medium (Western comics).
