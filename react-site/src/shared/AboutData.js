        first: 'Hello, my name is Weston. I am a Web Developer with experience using Bootstrap, React, and React Native.',
        second: 'On the internet I go by the alias MidZM. I\'m a web developer and artist with a knack for writing stories and working on large projects, usually alone. Occasionally I use my artistic skills to turn said stories into various artistic mediums such as games, webcomics, visual novels, etc. I rarely use my real name online, I\'m not a fan of my real name being on the public square for anyone to see. After witnessing peoples lives being completely ruined and destroyed over the smallest thing on the planet, I don\'t plan on reversing that decision anytime soon.',
        third: 'In my late teens I became a developer on a Garry\'s Mod server creating plugins and doing maintenance on the server, but left due to the increasing toxicity within the server. I once had plans to create a new gamemode for Garry’s Mod but due to time, a massive learning curve, and dealing with personal stuff it was an abandoned project, although at some point it would be interesting to continue.',
        fourth: 'While I was attending college I managed to pick up an Associates degree in art from Vol-State Community College and a web design certificate from Pellissippi State Community College. Originally this portfolio site was created as a project for college, since then it’s been completely overhauled to take advantage of modern technologies like Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, JSX, and React Native.'
